# Braking System

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger)

Pneumatic Braking:
> Pneumatic brake system or a compressed air brake system is a type of friction brake for vehicles in which compressed air pressing on a piston is used to apply the pressure to the brake pad needed to stop the vehicle.

# New Features!

  - We kept Pneumatic braking as backup braking:  - The doubly redundant pneumatic braking consists of two fully separate systems, both of which are equipped with an emergency bypass triggered by a loss of electrical power to the pneumatics activation valve.- The emergency bypass opens the pressure reservoir to the pneumatic cylinder, bypassing the Main Control Solenoid, which is closed in a powerless state. The Bypass Solenoid is opened in a powerless state and connected to the piston.- Along with redundancy in power safety, having two separate  pneumatic cylinders and systems protects the pod from the dangers of a loss of pressure or air leak.
