power requirements for jetson:
5.5V-19.6V(TX2)

the below links says
https://devblogs.nvidia.com/jetson-tx2-delivers-twice-intelligence-edge/
it pulls not more than 10Watt power
USB ports can regularly draw at most 2.5W each
everything at full capacity will draw not more than 30Watt ( be on safe side)

Jetsons are sensitive to very short power drop spikes at the moment of powering on.
You'd simply put a capacitor as close as possible to where the power cable connects to the Jetson.

we have to order DC male connector
e.g.,Power Cord with 2.1mmX5.5mm Barrel Plug to XT-60 Male plug

"A little note: it is really easy to damage a LiPo battery. The charge level of a single cell should not go under 3.0V, otherwise the cell will be damaged and the battery life reduced.
Furthermore the discharge rate is not linear and a cell takes very little time to drop from 3.3V to 3.0V."
